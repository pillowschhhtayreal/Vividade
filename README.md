Vividade , silly script by me. CHAOS script , autogiver and outfit price are kinda buggy , sorry. Open sourced because yes.
Loadstring for dumb people (like me) :

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pillowschhhtayreal/Vividade/refs/heads/main/vividade"))()

More updates soon , maybe...
